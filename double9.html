		<p id="text">
		The double 9th festival takes place on the 9th day of the 9th lunar month. The number nine is regarded as the number for Yang. Chong represents the word for double. Hence the festival literally translates to double nine. The festival is also referred to as Senior's day. On this day people eat Chongyang cake, drink chrysanthemum wine, climb mountains, and pay homage to Chrysanthemums. 

		<br></br>
		Disclaimer: The origin of the festival comes from different legends by 
		different provinces and villages. The main one about a village boy that 
		confronts the devil and persuades an immortal to help him defeat the devil and 
		save China from a plague.
